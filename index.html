        <p>Hello everyone!  My name is Sarah Goodell and I am working on building my skills as both a front and back end web developer.  I studied Secondary Education with a focus on English/Language Arts at the University of Central Florida, but quickly realized after two years of teaching that I knew I wanted to pursue my interests in software development.  I know the skills I used as a teacher will complement my future employer and make me a valued addition to their team.</p>
