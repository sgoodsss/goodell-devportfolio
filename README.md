## Credits 

I started my CSS stylesheet by using some of the code from the UCF Coding Bootcamp Module 1 Challenge. One of my peers, Christopher DeHaan, helped me with the code for the “My Work” section.  The tutor I met with, Charles “Tucker” Barrett, helped me with my responsive layout, and helped me perfect my “Contact Info” and “My Work” sections.
